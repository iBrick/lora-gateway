<b>Lora WAN indoor gateway designed by Adam Cigler - <a hlink="www.vjemy.cz">VJEMY.CZ</a></b> <br/>

This gateway housing enables the assembly of a Rasberry PI-3 and the European IMST iC880A LoRaWAN Concentrator board (868MHz).

Pins of both boards are kept as near as possible. This to avoid usage of long cables to reduce signal losses and interference.

<b>Mounting hardware</b> <br/>
The Raspberry can be fixed in the "electronics-interface-module" with M2 nuts and bolts(24mm length).

<b>Magnets</b> <br/>
Mounting the box and lid is done with 6 neodymium magents (4mm cubes).
The electronics are magneto-mounted into the box using a 12mm flat neodymium in the box and a 11mm washer ring.
On the botom of the box, 6 4mm neodymium cubes are mountable to be able to snap the gateway on a magnetic surface.
(or snap it on the inside of a window using other magnets on the outside..)

<b>Glue</b> <br/>
Magnets and the washer should be glued-in with epoxy.


<b>Tests</b> <br/>
We have tested this gateway for a month or two with The Things Network and found no influence of the magnets on the electronics. 

The short wiring helps providing a stable gateway without shielding the case. 


To accomodate outdoor installations in off-the-shelf waterproof DIN cases, the DIN interface file can be 3d-printed to integrate the neat electronics-interface-module in such housing.

It's a one -hour exercise..
