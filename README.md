<b>Lora WAN indoor gateway designed by Adam Cigler - VJEMY.CZ</b> <br/>

This gateway housing enables the assembly of a Rasberry PI 3 and the IMST iC880A - LoRaWAN Concentrator 868MHz.
Pins of the boards are kept as near as possible. This to avoid usage of long cables to reduce signal losses and interfearence.

<b>Hardware</b> <br/>
The Raspberry can be fixed in the "electronics-interface-module" with M2 nuts and bolts(24mm length).

<b>Magnets</b> <br/>
Mounting the box and lid is done with 6 neodym magents (4mm cubes).
The electronics are magneto-mounted into the box using a 12mm flat neodym in the box and a 11mm washer ring.
On the botom of the box, 6 4mm neodym cubes are mountable to be able to snap the gateway on a magnetic surface.
(or snap it on the inside of a window using other magnets on the outside..)

<b>Glue</b> <br/>
Magnets and the washer should be glued-in with epoxy.


<b>Tests</b> <br/>
We have tested this gateway for a month or two with The Things Network and found no influence of the magnets on the electronics.

The short wiring provides a stable gateway without shielding the case. 


To accomodate outdoor installations in off the shelf waterproof DIN cases, the simple DIN interface file can be printed to integrate the neat electronics-interface-module in such housing.
