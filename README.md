Lora WAN indoor gateway designed by Adam Cigler - VJEMY.CZ

This gateway housing enables the assembly of a Rasberry PI 3 and the IMST iC880A - LoRaWAN Concentrator 868MHz.
Pins of the boards are kept as near as possible. This to avoid usage of long cables and reduce signal losses and interfearence.

Hadware -
The Raspberry can be fixed in the holde with M2 nuts and bolts(24mm length).

Magenets <br/>
Mounting the box and lid is done with 6 neodym magents (4mm cubes).
The electronics are magneto-mounted into the box using a 12mm flat neodym in the box and a 11mm washer ring.
On the botom of the box, 6 4mm neodym cubes are mountable to be able to snap the gateway on a magnetic surface.
(or snap it on the inside of a window using other magnets on the outside..)

Glue
Magnets and the washer should be glued-in with epoxy.


Tests
We have tested this gateway for a month or two with The Things Network and found no influence of the magnets on the electronics.

The short wiring provides a stable gateway without shielding the case.
